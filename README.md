# JPDB Media Importer Chrome Extension

## Overview
This extension designed for **JPDB** users who want to enhance their learning experience by integrating custom images, audio, and sentences into the JPDB platform.
This extension enables users to fetch media from existing **Anki** decks and displays them during reviews.  You can create custom Anki cards with Images and audio using tools like **[asbplayer](https://github.com/killergerbah/asbplayer)** or **[subs2srs](https://subs2srs.sourceforge.net/)**, then sync the media from those decks to use within JPDB using this extension.

## Features
- Seamless integration of **images, audio, and sentence media** from Anki into JPDB.
- Automatic filtering and categorizing of media **based on the vocabulary present in the sentence**.
- With this extension, media is automatically injected into **JPDB vocabulary and review pages**.

## Requirements
To start using this extension, make sure you have the following:

- **JPDB API Key** Required for interacting with JPDB (Don't use the same API key shown in the Video, use the one available at the bottom of the JPDB settings page!).
- **Anki** (Installed on your computer).
- **Anki Connect Addon** (Installed in Anki).
- **Anki Deck** (Containing the media files you want to sync with JPDB).
- **Chrome Browser** (any browser which supports Chrome extensions).

## Webstore Installation
- Visit the following link and add to the browser **[JPDB Media Support](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/jpdb-media-support/pdhlakhlcgpogjkfaaidlnpogenbekif)**

## Manual Installation
- Download the code as a `.zip` file Directly or from Releases Page.
- Extract the zip file in a location of your choosing.
- Open up your browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
- Check the `Developer mode` switch at the top right of your window.
- Click the `Load unpacked` button at the top left.
- In the file picker dialog, navigate to the folder where you extracted earlier. You should see a file called manifest.json inside the folder.
- Click select/open/choose to exit the dialog and load the extension.

## Setup
### 1. Install Anki & Anki Connect
- Download and install **[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)**.
- Install the **[Anki Connect Addon](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159)** from AnkiWeb.

### 2. Configure the Extension
- Enter your **JPDB API Key** (which is crucial for categorizing media base on JPDB's VID).
- Set the **Anki Connect URL** (default: `http://localhost:8765`).
- Choose the **Anki Deck** which contains the cards to fetch media from.
- In the **Japanese Sentence Field** choose the field which contains the japanese sentence and in the **Translated Sentence Field** choose the field which contains English / any other explanation sentence. 
- Enable/disable **Auto Play Audio** and **Hide Native Sentence** as needed.
- Hit **Sync Data with Anki** to fetch all the data from the anki cards.
- Click **Save Config** to store your settings.

## How It Works
1. The extension fetches vocabulary from the **JPDB page** the user is currently on.
2. It then checks **Anki** (via Anki Connect) to see if there are any media files associated with that vocabulary.
3. If media files exist, they are **automatically injected** into JPDBâ€™s **Vocabulary** and **Review** pages.

## Troubleshooting
### 1. Media is not appearing on JPDB
- Ensure that **Anki is running** in the background.
- Check if **Anki Connect is installed** and responding at `http://localhost:8765`.
- Verify that the **deck and field names** in the extension match those in Anki.
- Make sure that the **each card's context field has some valid vocabulary**.
